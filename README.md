# Logical Textures

The texture pack I use in my Beyond Logic and Dissecting series. Here are the included textures:

* Redstone Power Level
* Smooth Redstone Dust
* Sticky Piston Heads
* Powered Observers
* Hopper Direction Arrows
* Star Trek Enterprise serial number noteblock lettering (used in my build in Beyond Logic YouTube series)
* Lower Shield
* Lower Fire
* Black Nether Brick
* Custom Paintings
* Logical Cats
* Logical Cows
* Orc Pigmen
* Green End Crystal beam (used in my build in Beyond Logic YouTube series for the Death Star beam)
* Storm Trooper Leather Armour

Some of the above textures were adapted from Vanilla Tweets to work in 1.13 until that pack is officially updated.
